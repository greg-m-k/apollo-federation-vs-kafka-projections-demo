# Apollo Federation vs Kafka Projections Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Git Operations - User Consent Required
**NEVER commit or push to git without explicit user request.**
- Only run `git commit` when the user explicitly asks to commit
- Only run `git push` when the user explicitly asks to push
- Always wait for user review and approval before any git operations
- This applies even after completing work - wait for the user to request commit/push

### II. Simplicity
Start simple, follow YAGNI principles. Don't over-engineer solutions.

### III. Test Changes Visually
When making UI changes, take screenshots to verify the changes work as expected before presenting to the user.

### IV. Transparency
Show the user what changes are being made. Don't make assumptions about what they want without asking.

## Development Workflow

- Make changes incrementally
- Build and test after each change
- Wait for user feedback before proceeding to next steps
- Never push code without explicit user consent

## Governance

This constitution governs all development work in this repository. The git consent rule is absolute and non-negotiable.
